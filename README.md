# Javascript Game Project

A practice project to combine HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.
This is for educational purposes and purely to learn and reflect on 

## Styling
The styling is inspired by the Apple IIc
I'm using the google font Press Start 2P as it is the only font Google offers that is close to the Chicago font used on old Apple devices.
The colours used are primarily a black, beige and some greens.

## Slap a Rabbit
A whack-a-mole clone.
Coding along with these tutorials:

The big head scratcher was trying to code three different difficulty levels. When I first coded this project, I had the different levels on different pages as I could link the difficulty to the class found on the start button element. Then the if statement in the popUp function would determine variable speeds (with the levelSpeed function) based on that class. Three pages with identical code - aside from the class on the start button - was, of course, incredibly redundant. 
I attempted varieties of if statements and different functions, which often ended up setting a single speed per level or not working at all! Eventually, I finally decided on a button each for the levels, which each had their own Event Listener that trigger different functions, which in turn set the difficulty level that the if statement in the popUp function uses to determine the speeds. And now the game is condensed to one page.

## Rock, Paper, Scissors
There's roughly one million tutorials for a rock, paper, scissors game online using JavaScript.
I used these:

I have changed it a bit from when I first created the project as a bare bones example of RPS. Today I used a ![free clipart image](https://www.clipartmax.com/middle/m2i8i8G6H7K9Z5H7_rock-paper-scissors-clipart-rock-paper-scissors-clip-art/) to create images that could be clicked to make your selection. Then your own and the computer's selections are displayed and the result of the immediate game is updated. Your scores are incremented. And I adapted my game over screen from the Slap a Rabbit game to play after 5 wins or losses. From there you can play again or go home. I think there is probably a simple way to make that game over screen more reusable, I'll have to look into it.
It's not too fancy, but I like it. I like the interactivity and feedback to the user with all the updating parts when a selection is made. I think I could easily update it to add more variants (lizard, Spock, for example). I also think it looks pretty good on the game screen. I think it fits the theme quite well.
